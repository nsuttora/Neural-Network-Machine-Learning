# Neural-Network-Machine-Learning
Implemented from scratch a neural netowrk to make accurate predictions on the iris dataset: determining the iris species based on sepal length/width and petal length/width. Used data visualization techniques to plot the original iris dataset, the loss over time for the training phase, and the accuracy over time for the prediction phase.
